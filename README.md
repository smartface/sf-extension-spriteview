## Installation
SpriteView can be installed via npm easily from our public npm repository. The installation is pretty easy via Smartface Cloud IDE.

- Open scripts/package.json file inside your workspace.
- Add SpriteView extension dependency as:`"sf-extension-spriteview": "^1.0.0"`
- Run command `npm update` under the folder `scripts`
- Finally require the extension as: `require("sf-extension-spriteview")`

## How to use
SpriteView is nothing but a [UI.ImageView](http://ref.smartface.io/#!/api/UI.ImageView) with additional methods. Since it extends ImageView, you can add it inside layouts.

1) Put the sprite sheet under the folder `images` on the Cloud IDE. 
2) Set the sheet to the SpriteView object as:
```javascript
spriteObject.setSprite({
	sheet: Image.createFromFile("images://spritesheet.png"),
	frameX: << #frames in axis-X >>, // Number
	frameY: << #frames in axis-Y >>, // Number
	frameCount: << #frames in the sheet >> // Number
});
```
3) Finally you must make the sprite play by using:
```javascript
spriteObject.play(<< loop duration in ms >>); // Number
```

## Sample
The folder `sample` holds the example codes and the sprite sheet. You can put them into your workspace and start using it.
